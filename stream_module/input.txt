Hi !
This is the nodeJs Tutorial.
Node js is a javascript runtime Built on chrome's V8 javascript engine. 

finally stream........

In 2009 an idea vcame in the mind of Ryan Dahl(Google Engineer) That why not run JvaScript OutSide Browser, So he took V8 engine and embedded in a C++ Program and called it node.exe later on became NodeJS.
