   # About NodeJS
  🟢 Node js is a javascript runtime Built on chrome's V8 javascript engine.
  
   🟢Node js is a javascript running on the server.
   
# 📌History⏰:
In 2009 an idea vcame in the mind of Ryan Dahl(Google Engineer) That why not run JvaScript OutSide Browser, So he took V8 engine and embedded in a C++ Program and called it node.exe later on became NodeJS.
    
  #  📌V8 engine📗: 
  One type of javaScript engine develope by Chrome's to convert Machine understable lang and run this Javascript language.
    ➡like google chorm fire fox has SpiderMonkey
    
  #  📌 Using 🐱‍🚀:
                  1. I/O bound .
                  2. Data Streaming Applications.
                  3. Real time Chat application.
     
   # 📌 Installing nodeJS🐱‍🚀:
     Step 1: Download Node.js Installer >> https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
     
     Step 2: Install Node.js 
     
     Step 3: Verify Installation   >> node -v
   
 #  📌 npm 🐱‍🚀: 
 NPM – or "Node Package Manager" – is the default package manager for JavaScript's runtime Node.js.
 
    1. a CLI (command-line interface) tool for publishing and downloading packages.
    2. an online repository that hosts JavaScript packages

* NPM is the world's largest Software Library.
* npm is also a software Package Manager and Installer.
 

  # 📌 ES6 🐱‍🚀: 
  ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6 is the 6th version of the ECMAScript programming language.

   ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015, and is also known as ECMAScript 2015.
   
   It is for creating a general purpose scripting language.In simple terms it is a standardization for creating a scripting language.It was introduced by Ecma International, and is basically an implementation with which we learn how to create a scripting language. 

 #  📌 REPL 🐱‍🚀: 
 The REPL feture of node is very usefuk in experimenting with Node.Js codes and to debug Javascript codes
       
   R- Read user's input , parses the input into javascript data-structure, and stores in the memory.
   
   E- Thakes and evaluates the data Structure
   
   P- print the result.
   
   L- Loops the above command until the user presses ctrl-c twic.

       1. js Expression.
       2. use variables.
       3. multiline code/ Loops.
       4. Use (_) to get last result.
       5. we can use editor mode.

 #  📸🐱 some Command for Node Terminal
   .help --- use to more information.
   
   tab + tab --- use to all information.
   
   editor mode :  .editor
   
      // Entering editor mode (Ctrl+D to finish, Ctrl+C to cancel)

          const name = (myname)=>
          {
             console.log(`my name is ${myname}`);
          }
          name("sastik kumar das");
          
   # 📌 NodeJs core Module 🐱‍🚀: 
   consider mudules to be the same as javascript librarries. A set of functions you wnat to include in your application. 
   
   Nodejs has set of built-in Modules which you can use without any further installation.
  # 📌 NodeJs web server 🐱‍🚀:
  to  access web pages of any webapplication ,we need a web server.the web server will handle all the http requests for the web application.
  
  e.g -- IIS is a web server for ASP.NET web applications and Apache is a web server for PHP or java Web applications.

  Node.js provides capabilities to creat our own web server which  will handle HTTP requests asynchronously.
  we can use IIS or Apache to run Node.js web application but it is recommended to use Node.js web server.
   # 📌 JSON 🐱‍🚀: 
   JSON stand for Javascript Object Notation.
        
   JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data.
        
   JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web pages.

   # 📌 API 🐱‍🚀: 
   API is the acronym for application Programming interface,Which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you an app like Facebook,Send an instat message ,or check the weather on your phone ,you are using an API.

   # 📌 Event module 🐱‍🚀:
   NodeJs has a built-in module, called 'event',where you can creat-,fire-, and listten for our own events.

   #  📌 Streams in NodeJS 🐱‍🚀:
   Streams are objects that let you read data from a sorce or write data to a destination in continuous fashion. there are 4 types of streams-
        
   streaming means listening to music or watching video in 'real time', instad of downloading a file to your computer and watching it later
           
        1. Readable - use for read operation
        2. Writable - used for write operation
        3. Duplex - used for both read and write operation
        4. Transfrom - a type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input
